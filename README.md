# En-Dictionary
A GUI based open-source English dictionary for desktop. Feel free to install & use. Also available the code for developers.

# How it works
Since the dictionary doesn't use 'API keys' primarily, it provides you the full customization of the dictionary database.

it has it's own json file as the database. If the word you searched doesn't contain the database, it will use API keys to fetch the word from online & show you the result also save the word in json file. 

Again, if you misspell the searched word it will suggest you the closest similar word.

if the searched word doesn't found in neither json file nor API key, it will simply ask you to enter the result of the word & save it in json file.

Also you can edit the result of the searched word & save the changes in json file.
This code is completely written in python & no need to install python interpreter to excute it.

You can also use keybinding to make a shortcut to excute the app
