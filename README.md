# **Intelligent Offline & Online Dictionary | Smart Word Lookup & Pronunciation**  

A powerful, user-friendly **offline & online dictionary** with an interactive graphical interface. It provides definitions, examples, synonyms, and antonyms for words using both **offline data** and an **online API**.

Additionally, the project includes a **standalone dictionary app** built using PyInstaller, allowing users to use the dictionary without running Python scripts.

## **Features**  

âœ” **Offline & Online Search** â€“ Retrieves word details from a local JSON database and an online API if not found offline.  
âœ” **Intelligent Word Matching** â€“ Uses Levenshtein distance to suggest similar words if the search term is incorrect.  
âœ” **GUI-Based Search** â€“ Built using **Tkinter**, offering an easy-to-use graphical interface.  
âœ” **Word Management** â€“ Allows users to **add, edit, and overwrite** words in the offline dictionary.  
âœ” **Speech Feature** â€“ Pronounces words using the `espeak-ng` package.  
âœ” **Dictionary App** â€“ A compiled **standalone app** built with **PyInstaller**, eliminating the need for Python installation.

## **How It Works**  

1. **Searching for a Word:**  
   - Type a word in the search box and press **Enter** or click **Search**.  
   - If the word is found in the offline dictionary, its details will be displayed.  
   - If the word isnâ€™t found, the application will try fetching it from the online API.  

2. **Word Suggestions:**  
   - If a word is misspelled, the program suggests a close match.  
   - You can accept the suggestion or manually add a new word.  

3. **Adding a Word:**  
   - If a word is not found, you can choose to add it to the offline dictionary.  
   - Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter a definition, examples, synonyms, and antonyms.  

4. **Editing a Word:**  
   - If a word exists in the dictionary, you can overwrite its details by clicking **Edit**.  

5. **Deleting an Entry (Manually):**  
   - Open `offline_dictionary.json` and remove the desired entry.  

6. **Pronunciation Feature:**  
   - Click **Pronounce** to hear the word spoken using `espeak-ng`.

## **Offline Dictionary File**
